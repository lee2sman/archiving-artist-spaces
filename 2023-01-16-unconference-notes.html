are some of the archives you‚Äôd like to start or collections or
communities you‚Äôre part of that you think are worthy of
‚Äòarchiving‚Äô?</h3>
<p>Unconference 23!<br />
ELO salons! Yeah, my bad on that. I‚Äôll get to it. Time is tough@ (no
comment on it being done or not!)<br />
Climate change digital fictions<br />
Alan The text with Atkinson/Baldwin - the actually ‚Äúlook‚Äù might be
important - they were part of Art and Language I think?<br />
Pandemic debris/signage,</p>
<p>experiences of people knowing the world before the internet and then
experiencing the internet now Yes, from someone who grew up without the
internet. Or computers.</p>
<p>An archive of the RFC re: internet and the back-materials for each of
them<br />
An archive of 19th-century family photo albums - most of these get
destroyed -<br />
An archive of high-school graduation yearbook comments - most of these
are thrown out -</p>
<p>Subversive digital fictions where they‚Äôre not supposed to exist
(e.g., Amazon‚Äôs bic for her pen reviews, fake customer services accounts
on socials, etc.) If we are going to subvert, we should record the
sub-version</p>
<p>Twitter, before the man-child destroys it completely<br />
Mastadon?<br />
Do we want to archive all of those pictures of dinners people ate in FB?
My grandmother saved the menu from her cross-Atlantic trip and I still
have that, so I am not sure!)<br />
Fanzines<br />
Collaborative fictions (creepypastas, wikis, SCP Foundation, etc.)<br />
Locative fiction</p>
<p>Independent forms of digital fiction<br />
REader experiences with Flash works<br />
The NEXT is amazing. IT even has archives of archives</p>
<p>An archive of my experimental interactive website projects. Links to
them, screenshots and 1-sentence description.<br />
Archives of net provs@</p>
<p>Actually, some of the 1990s web cam folks who were on the web all the
time. Reminds me of Ted Nelson‚Äôs archives of every moment of his
life.</p>
<p>An archive of the mini code golf art community that previously
(still?) existed on twitter, creating small strange animated images and
text-poems.</p>
<p>An archive of National Novel Generating month (nanogenmo) entries.
Currently exists mostly in GitHub issues, not the most publicly
facing/engaging)</p>
<p>Federation (30+ year old multiplayer text game)</p>
<p>Everything? wait, maybe not everything. But, perhaps? :)</p>
<h3 id="what-digital-materials-do-you-want-to-preserve">What (digital)
materials do you want to preserve?</h3>
<p>collaborative digital fictions - text files of the
forums/reviews/discussions, but also screenshots of the same, as some
are highly linked to images</p>
<p>system of metadata for whatever it is I‚Äôm archiving.</p>
<p>NaNoGenMo Entries - lists of each entry, link to each work, short
description. Screenshot?</p>
<p>version of texts - as evolution and all the
collaboration/collaborative dynamics on it</p>
<p>I am afraid that ALL digital materials will leave soon, or not be
available in a century as the energy needed for digital preservation,
computers and hardware and software are going to disappear soon. I made
a hyperbook sorta related to this. The internet and fake news destroys
the world, lol. - http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=ylqhzaposlxyvqfb</p>
<p>Federation - Early material on community management, including
material from AOL internal mailing lists / staff manuals. Web archives
of fan/player sites, original Interactive Broadcasting website. Code
changes and design changes to the game over time. Time-indexing &amp;
cross-references to the various sources of info. Scanned images of
player-made maps and design sketches</p>
<p>I printed out my small works‚Äìbut these created an entirely new work
and experience. So we have to think about how people will experience
these archives differently.</p>
<p>Who are we archiving for? and do they want the archives?</p>
<h3 id="how-do-we-want-to-archive">How do we want to archive?</h3>
<p>Do we want archives to be accessible?<br />
I wish there was an archive it button that would just copy the webpage
or digital object and put it somewhere on a cloud‚Ä¶ with forms for
metadata. Wayback machine can do something like this! There is
‚ÄúArchive-It‚Äù, a more industrial tool by the Internet Archive (with a
monthly/annual fee, though they indicated they would share this with
DIY/non-profits as well)</p>
<p>Poke Dene to do it, lol. Poor Dene and her crew! Had we but world
enough or time‚Ä¶ I know!</p>
<p>Could we get a time machine and go interview future folks to find out
what they want archived</p>
