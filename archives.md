### AS-AP

[AS-AP on Internet Archive's Wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20190208082004/https://as-ap.org/)

Description: Note: this site was archived by the Internet Archive wayback machine but to the best of my knowledge was not preserved by the organizers. Not all pages were saved. "Art Spaces Archives Project [AS-AP] is a non-profit initiative founded in 2003 by a consortium of alternative arts organizations, including Bomb Magazine, the College Art Association, Franklin Furnace Archive, New York State Council on the Arts [NYSCA], New York State Artist Workspace Consortium, and The Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, with a mandate to help preserve, present, and protect the archival heritage of living and defunct for- and not-for-profit art spaces in the United States from the 1950's to the present."

With funding provided by NYSCA, The National Endowment for the Arts, and the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, AS-AP was initiated with a mandate to begin the documentation process by constructing a national index of the producers and presenters of alternative and avant-garde art.

### Elevator Mondays

[Elevator Mondays](https://donedler.com/index.php?/elevator/elevator-book/)

Description: "ELEVATOR MONDAYS, a social exhibition space built inside a decommissioned 4ft x 6ft freight elevator....the project revolved around weekly Monday night community BBQs at our studio building. These pot-luck events were social opportunities for members of the LA art community to come together and hang out once a week with friends and food. Following in this tradition, ELEVATOR MONDAYS functions as a social space for art and dialogue. The intimate scale and discrete location of the space allows for a more personal, conversational experience for both the viewers and the artists."

### HBML

[HBML Documentation](http://www.rf5.org/hbml/)

Description: "HBML was a storefront arts space in Worcester MA in the guise of a donation-based thrift store. HBML hosted exhibits by varying artists and sold used goods...This is a series of web pages to serve as incomplete documentation. Pictures are not ordered chronologically, in themes, or in order of importance, but by file name. Things will be out of order, but related pics have a strong likelihood of being grouped. I think that's as good a way to approach the material as any. No one (except me I guess) experienced the store in a chronological way, it was always just, you'd come in, and there were layers of things, echos of the past, and areas of potential for future action. These pics are not good documentation by art project standards, or by any standards really! They were just taken by people at the store, or by me for some other purpose, or by me for no purpose."

The focus is on mid-1980's textfiles and the world as it was then, but even these files are sometime retooled 1960s and 1970s works, and offshoots of this culture exist to this day.

### UbuWeb

[UbuWeb](https://ubuweb.com/)

Description: "Founded in 1996, UbuWeb is a pirate shadow library consisting of hundreds of thousands of freely downloadable avant-garde artifacts. By the letter of the law, the site is questionable; we openly violate copyright norms and almost never ask for permission. Most everything on the site is pilfered, ripped, and swiped from other places, then reposted. We’ve never been sued—never even come close. UbuWeb functions on no money—we don’t take it, we don’t pay it, we don’t touch it; you’ll never find an advertisement, a logo, or a donation box. We’ve never applied for a grant or accepted a sponsorship; we remain happily unaffiliated, keeping us free and clean, allowing us to do what we want to do, the way we want to do it."
