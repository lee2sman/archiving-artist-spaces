Artist-Run and DIY Spaces Online Activities Workshop</h1>
<p>Strategic Preservation of Online Communities: A Workshop. ISEA 2023.
Lee Tusman.</p>
<p>Title on top of a black and white 1970s image of Community Memory.
Community Memory was a networked electronic bulletin board system
installed in record shops and other community centers in Berkeley, CA in
the 1970s. In the image are two people sitting at a computer terminal in
front of a physical bulletin board. The terminal has a plastic cover and
cardboard side panel that says Community Memory in hand drawn
marker.</p>

<li>Case studies</li>
<li>Practical, hands-on</li>
<li>Bring our whole selves, backgrounds, experiences, knowledge and

</ul>
<p>I‚Äôll show many examples of archives, including several that I‚Äôve
built, and show how I turned zines, press releases, scraped or collected
images, and oral history interviews into web-based archives, as well as
how I‚Äôm planning for longterm archiving.</p>

<h3 id="elc">ELC</h3>
<p>Electronic Literature Collection screenshot, Collection 1. A grid of
screenshots of electronic literature, labeled Electronic Literature
Collection Volume One.</p>
<h3 id="textfiles">Textfiles</h3>
<p>I like the questions listed on the front page of textfiles.com Where
are the files? Who are you? Why does this matter? What was it like? How
can I help? The ‚ÄúWhat was it like?‚Äù question seems very important to me,
and hardest to answer. Image is a screenshot of textfiles.com with the
title and a description and the above questions.</p>
<p>Description: A screenshot of Textfile Writing Groups. There is a text
description of how groups of close internet friends in the 80s formed
informal groups and published files on online bulletin boards under
their group names. Examples in the screenshot are 9X, AnarchyInc, BAR.
The text appears like an old terminal - green text on black.</p>
<h3 id="museum-of-zzt">Museum of ZZT</h3>
<p>ZZT is a text-mode game from 1991 created by Tim Sweeney of Epic
Games. ZZT has its own editor and scripting language which offers what
may still be an unmatched level of accessibility to beginning game
developers. A significant number of ZZT worlds were created by authors
in their early teenage years, with some being made by children under 10.
ZZT‚Äôs simple ZZT-OOP scripting language gave many a friendly
introduction to programming. Description: Screenshot of Museum of ZZT. A
text description, excerpted above, and a grid of ‚ÄúNew Releases‚Äù showing
screenshots of various ZZT game-worlds.</p>
<p>The goal of the Museum of ZZT site is to collect these worlds, offer
discussions into them and the community built around them, and keep them
safely preserved. It is the hope of the Museum that the generally
unknown works of ZZT community can be easily discovered and that their
importance can be recognized.</p>

randomly selected zines. There is Fuzz Box and Queer Fanzine Roze Lente
97 Special, both in a roughly photocopied punk aesthetic.</p>
<h3 id="little-berlin">Little Berlin</h3>
<p>Little Berlin website. A screenshot of a simple mid 2000s website.
There is a youtube video of the Little Berlin Annex. Below is a text
description explaining Little Berlin is over (RIP) and what happened
(the building sold) and a link to find out about members, events, about,
zine library, press. For this archive I scraped the original squarespace
and added additional content and replicated the web 1.0 site design, in
collaboration with Peter Erickson.</p>
<h3 id="experimental-archive-space">Experimental Archive Space</h3>
<p>Description: A screenshot of the Experimental Archive Space, an
archive of Space 1026. On the left is a description of this DIY space
from Philadelphia, PA. On the right are some images and text. The text
are links to a zine maker online, photos and about. Giant questions in
the forefront are How is it run? How do you deal with conflict? What
would you like other DIY spaces to know? How has Space 1026 maintained
itself‚Ä¶? There is an image of a person wearing a wig and bright sequined
vest holding a mic. And a photo of a pink spider-looking sculpture. I
directed this archive project for Space 1026 with designer/programmer
Caleb Stone.</p>
<p>A screenshot of Space 1026 photos section showing a shoebox approach
to collecting images. There are layers of overlapping images from Space
1026 over the years such as people playing music in the street -
accordion and banjo. There are soft sculptures, a drawing of a dog in a
cap, half-covered, labeled ‚ÄúOf Egypt‚Äù, a pixelated flower illustration,
and a postcard of a flyer for a show for a A Film by Robert Millis of
Sublime Frequencies in 2010.</p>
<p>A screenshot of the Zine Maker software on Experimental Archive
Space, showing an interface to select color quantity and length. In the
center is a generated zine with the question What would you advise
people who want to start their own space and collective, and two
responses from Andrew And Ben from oral history interviews.</p>

<h3 id="ubuweb">UbuWeb</h3>
<p>UbuWeb is over two decades old. Started as a way to share avant garde
art and film, it morphed into something stranger, and is largely built
off files collected from torrents and the like. The screenshot shows the
landing page of UbuWeb, a very minimal late 1990s era style design. In
the top left is a black and white image of a man‚Äôs head, I believe John
Cage.</p>
