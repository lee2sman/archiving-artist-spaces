# Reading


This is a selected reading list of web-based articles and some books that relate to the topic of archiving artist-run spaces and digital preservation. As search engines have become optimized to present the latest updated pages, on larger platforms or brand sites, and with an eye toward monetization, it gets harder and harder to find great blog posts, articles, and tutorials. This is a directory of interesting and useful links that have inspired me.
