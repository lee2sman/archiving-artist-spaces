<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>Archiving Artist-Run Spaces was created as a resource for
experimental artist communities, both physical spaces as well as
online-only creator communities, to build archives of their
activities.</p>
<p>It is based on my two decades of experience working in DIY spaces and
artist-run communities and identifying unmet needs in the space. Just as
these spaces attempt to carve out their own place in the world and make
their own home and culture, there is a mismatch with their values when
artist-run communities use commercial platforms for presenting or
hosting their work. Just as an art space could be forced to close due to
rising rents, many platforms have come and gone over the years, changed
their business models, or sites or passwords have been misplaced.
Recognizing that many exhibits, images, articles, web-based projects,
and documentation disappears due to link rot this site‚Äôs goal is to help
artist-run communities think through the value of what they‚Äôre engaged
in and how they may want to strategically preserve some aspect of
themselves online. This project isn‚Äôt meant to replace the needs for
professional archivists but rather to provide possibilities in the DIY
spirit of these communities who often rely on the strength of their own
networks.</p>
<h2 id="about-the-design-of-this-site">About the design of this
site</h2>
<p>This site was made with homemade, simple and open source tools with
an eye toward creating an attractive website minimizing bandwidth and
maximizing readability and longevity of the site. The pages are written
in markdown, a lightweight language that is mostly just plaintext with
some formatting marks, so it can be scanned and read itself, or rendered
to a static HTML page. You are either reading this as the static website
or as a markdown text file right now.</p>
<p>The style of the page is meant to reflect these values. No external
fonts are loaded. Visitors will see default typefaces. The logo is a
system emoji. There is no tracking on the website, no ads and no
cookies. As far as one can know, no Google, Facebook, or Amazon
resources have been used.</p>
<p>The style reflects maximizing text and making it easy to read and
scan a page with your eyes or with page scanners. A palette of 8 colors
was selected from lospec.com.</p>
<p>No Javascript is required to view or navigate the site. Media queries
are used to resize the font for readability on small screens. Where
possible, images have been compressed to support minimizing page
load.</p>
<p>Pages are written in markdown and converted to html with a simple
homemade static generator based on the free libre program Pandoc.</p>
