# Devlog for Archiving Artist Spaces

### 2022-02-20

The Digital Preservation Commission is a UK and Ireland company and charity that works to help its members "secure our digital legacy." They host events, a blog, post on social media, video webinars on preservation topics and tools, and a Digital Preservation Handbook. Their extensive handbook, originally created in 2001 and refined in a 2nd edition and updated in phases is licensed Open Government licence v3.0, allowing re-use. It provides a good example for a toolkit, where mine can be aimed more specifically for shoestring artist-run-spaces.

There was an article in NPR today about archiving artwork from the Black Lives Matter protest on the fence that stood between The White House and Lafayette Park during 2020 protests.

The fence stood for 6 months and was a site that accumulated signs, artwork, scraps, and messages. In the article it describes a confluence of factors where both the participants and supporters of the protest (and the fence monument and artifacts) recognized the worth and value of each individual and the collective material on that fence; as well, archivists worked with the activists to preserve these pieces, which are now being displayed online and the physical artifacts will be preserved as well.

Over 800 signs were saved from the fence. It's really clear how much these kinds of archival projects can be communal, shared caretaking.

> The signs are being housed in a storage unit in Washington, D.C., as they await to be scanned by archivists at Baltimore's Enoch Pratt Free Library, a joint project with the D.C. Public Library. 

A collection of the signs was exhibited to mark the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa race massacre. Howard University acquired some of the signs. Some other museums expressed interest in owning pieces as well once all the items have been scanned (when I look today I count only 37 items scanned). They have still to decide how to break up the items and where they should go after. 

Looking at the metadata for each individual item I see Title, Date Created/Published, Medium, Summary, Reproduction Number, Rights Advisory, Call Number, Repository, Notes, Subjects, Format, Collections. 

An excerpt from one item:

> Poster was removed from the Black Lives Matter Memorial Fence, an installation of protest art attached to a chain link fence outside of the White House, Washington, D.C, from June 2020 through January 2021, responding to the murder of George Floyd on May 25, 2020, and other instances of police brutality against African Americans; other issues addressed by posters on the fence include institutional injustices, political protest, frustration and mourning related to COVID-19, and international solidarity.
> Forms part of: [Posters from the Black Lives Matter Memorial Fence in Washington, D.C.].
> Gift; Nadine Seiler & Karen Irwin on behalf of the BLM community; 2021; (DLC/PP-2021:011).

I also checked out the George Floyd and Anti-Racist Street Art Archive online. Some phrases that stand out to me on this linked web archive: "Use of images: Images and metadata available in this database are intended for non-commercial educational use only. The intention of this database is to document and analyze street art for scholarship, research, and teaching. Whenever possible we have included the names of artists responsible for creating these works. If you notice any errors or ommisions, please let us know!" The site and works are also licensed CC 4.0 SA.

I'm curious whether Library of Congress might be a good fit for the collections of digital artifacts (and possibly paper/item artifacts) as well from the artist-run archives I'm working with. And lastly, I'm making a note to possibly get in touch with Aliza Leventhal, co-founder of Society of American Archivist's Digital Design Records Taskforce.

Learning from LACA:

I spent the afternoon today in the stacks of Los Angeles Contemporary Archive (LACA), meeting with the director Hailey, and going through various books and collections of files. LACA identifies as an "artist-run archive" and a non-circulating library "in which creative processes are recorded and preserved." 

> The Archive houses and catalogues art-related objects, with a special focus on underexposed artistic modes of expression and ephemeral materials. The Archive includes studio and performance ephemera, artists' writings, audio-visual recordigs, digital media files and institutional archives of artist-run spaces.

LACA has a great bound binder with documents about its purpose, collections, intentions, mission, as well as short, medium and long term planning. I found it really helpful to go through the whole thing, as it prompted me to consider lots of questions to consider while working on this project and producing a useful toolkit and tools for archiving artist-run spaces digitally.

Here's an example of the kinds of content I found in the archival storage box of Human Resources (artist-run space in LA):
* binders with bills, paid or unopened
* printed press releases, exhibition checklists, art statements
* gallery visitor sign-in sheets with individually written names and emails
* exhibition proposal letters sent to the director
* rejected grant letters written by Human Resources

I loved reading through the short term, medium term and longterm goals listed by LACA. Some items from 'medium term':

* institute a system for processing backlogged items
* create manuals for communicating appropriate handling of materials
* collaborative emergency response planning with neighboring archives in the event of a localized disaster
* physical supplies and maintenance for the space and physical preservation

Some questions for LACA:
* what practices can a space follow to ensure longterm protection of their creative activities?
* what kinds of institutions might a space outside of LA want to be in contact with about caretaking or archiving their work?
* is it important to print out web-based material (press releases, posts, exhibition pages, emails) for archiving?
* are you concerned about photocopy paper degrading?
* how do you decide which materials from an artist space to preserve?

I started thinking about the contents of the toolkit I will build for spaces interested in self-preservation archiving. Here's some questions that can go in the 'assessment' / how-to document:

* what kinds of materials exist (e.g. photo documentation of performances, instagram posts...)
* what should be saved? how will you decide?
* which of this do you already have?
* what materials are out 'there' that you need help accessing? how can you gain access to preserve it?

Some items I should put together:
* mission
* collections - what do we preserve?
* programs - trainings, what else?
* I'll want to put together a consent/oral history intake form. 

While looking at all of these physical artifacts and books today I realized I need to clarify how what I'm working on (archiving digital collections) relates to physical archives. I probably should have recomendations for groups wishing to donate physical artifacts. 

LACA itself needs some help upgrading its Drupal. It's been busy working on its physical space and archiving items and now needs some help (likely financial and technical) to upgrade the backend of its web presence, and then later likely modernize its front end. I shared the concept of using 'boring technology', tried and true technology that has been used for a long time and will likely continue to be used and maintained.

One last thing to mention: many of the collections coming in to LACA are donated without any explanation or context. But over time it's unclear what items are or how they relate to a space or artist. This is similar to how I've found lots of photos without metadata; it's unclear the subject, what year or person it relates to, or the story of what we're seeing. Collecting this kind of info may be difficult and I'll have to think through ways to help people create contextual information.

Many of the archival books relating to artist-run spaces I reviewed consisted primarily of photo documentation, with a few essays or interviews at the end. Some others were roganized differently, with receipts or emails short welcome message., or maybe a filled out new member/application form from each participant. Increasingly, I think in addition to these web archives having a physical book is important as well. It can find different audiences as it can be more easily shared. It can act as an intentional mini-archive of sorts, displaying items or people or collections or artifacts it deems important and providing context. This is also prompting me to think about my potential creation of this kind of book layout software that can help with this.

Took a hike in Griffith Park with Brianna, Nina, Don, Gu. Spoke with Don about Elevator Mondays, his former DIY space in Pico Union. I used to visit when I lived in LA. I talked about my project and spoke about the generative zine-making part. He designed Elevator Mondays/Elevator Book in 2020: "The 314 page book features over 150 artists across 20+ exhibitions, images of exhibition documentation are combined with studio visit snap shots and personal images of friends, hikes, and dogs...there are lots of dogs in this book." We made plans to meet up again so I can check out the hand made artist books and look at my generative zine-making software. I'm also going to meet up with Ceci and looking forward to talking about these issues with GAS, and Eva at Coaxial, and LACA and Human Resources.

Questions:

* Who are these archives for? (beginning to answer: 'alumni' of these spaces, the greater public who may be interested in their activity, future scholars/artists/communities who may want to research and learn about these communities and their activities)
* Who owns these archives as a whole and their items (photos, text, other elements) individually? (beginning to answer: the groups who contributed them, the 'public', no one)
* What are we including? missing? leaving out? (beginning to answer: 'archived' frozen or cloned websites, social media images, oral history.; video recordings, physical media; those that didn't know or want to participate)
* What is the goal? (to build archives and tools to attempt to capture some part of the artist creative and intellectual output and the community that develops out of these spaces. to be caretakers and share these archives for future audiences / generations. to build awareness of archiving needs and tools that artist-run communities can use.)

This week I looked at Content Management Systems (CMS) options for static sites. I didn't find much. I lean away from Wordpress and most other CMS because they're PHP and dynamic, opening them up to being hacked, requiring constant upgrade cycles and the complications of competing plugins. On the other hand a CMS allows non-coders to create and edit a site, so it would be nice to find something like this I could recommend to less-techinical artist spaces. One option I looked at are Wordpress -> static site output generators. The simplest and complete is SimplyStatic but it needs a $100 PRO annual account for the features I'd want, and it's not open source.

Today I worked with Pete, a past organizer at Little Berlin (along with me and many others). He used OctoParse to grab the text content from all events, members and press pages and convert them to spreadsheets that he put in Google Drive. Spreadsheet files, such as from Google sheets or Excel or open source alternatives like Etherpad can be easily exported as CSV data files. I built a parser in node.js, using csv-parse and the built-in fs filesystem packages to ingest the events.csv file and then render out separate html pages for each separate event. I inject the basic html tags around these so the rendered page is html5.

My next step was to tackle CSS. I turned on the developer features for the Squarespace site. I git cloned to downloaded the site to my local computer. Sniffing around the template file I was unable to find the obfuscated actual rendered CSS output, and the less css preprocessor files didn't seem to render out the Little Berlin site theme. Probably there's some other hidden magic that Squarespace hides, since that's how they make their money. 

Okay, so my next step, from scratch, I wrote some CSS using flexbox, my layout tool of choice since it's canon and easy to get going from examples. The Little Berlin site is pretty basic, so I just needed to make a "Holy Grail" layout in Flexbox, and spent time getting this set up. I got a good approximation, showed Pete.

Still to come: some of the rendered pages using my parser get messed up and don't export nor display error message. I'm guessing it's happening on pages where the description text incorporates forbidden characters possibly, like pipe, extra dots, quotes, commas. Will need to come back and verify and correct this. *(Update: correct! fixed.)*

Some notes on using wget on a domain to download images:

```
wget -nd -r -A jpeg,jpg,bmp,gif,png --level=inf https://domain.com
```

This uses wget to download all images recursively through infinite levels of sub-directories and save them all into the single folder. At some point it seemed to get stuck (when it got to 3880 downloaded images) so I re-ran the command with the -c flag (continue), which allows it to check headers of previous files.

Next I used Windows software to brute-force download every public photo from Space 1026 account on one of the platforms due to them not having access to that account anymore. When so many people organize a space, who holds the passwords? How do you manage them? Not an easy thing for many small businesses to handle, much less a small no-profit artist-run collective.

Then Caleb and I reviewed some of our Experimental Archive Space designs.
