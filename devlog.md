# Devlog for Archiving Artist Spaces

### 2022-02-06

Took a hike in Griffith Park with Brianna, Nina, Don, Gu. Spoke with Don about [Elevator Mondays](https://www.instagram.com/elevatormondays/), his former DIY space in Pico Union. I used to visit when I lived in LA. I talked about my project and spoke about the generative zine-making part. He designed Elevator Mondays/Elevator Book in 2020: "The 314 page book features over 150 artists across 20+ exhibitions, images of exhibition documentation are combined with studio visit snap shots and personal images of friends, hikes, and dogs...there are lots of dogs in this book." We made plans to meet up again so I can check out the hand made artist books and look at my generative zine-making software. I'm also going to meet up with Ceci and looking forward to talking about these issues with GAS, and Eva at Coaxial, and LACA and Human Resources.
