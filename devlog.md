# Devlog for Archiving Artist Spaces

### 2022-02-06

Took a hike in Griffith Park with Brianna, Nina, Don, Gu. Spoke with Don about [Elevator Mondays](https://www.instagram.com/elevatormondays/), his former DIY space in Pico Union. I used to visit when I lived in LA. I talked about my project and spoke about the generative zine-making part. He designed Elevator Mondays/Elevator Book in 2020: "The 314 page book features over 150 artists across 20+ exhibitions, images of exhibition documentation are combined with studio visit snap shots and personal images of friends, hikes, and dogs...there are lots of dogs in this book." We made plans to meet up again so I can check out the hand made artist books and look at my generative zine-making software. I'm also going to meet up with Ceci and looking forward to talking about these issues with GAS, and Eva at Coaxial, and LACA and Human Resources.

Questions:

* Who are these archives for? (beginning to answer: 'alumni' of these spaces, the greater public who may be interested in their activity, future scholars/artists/communities who may want to research and learn about these communities and their activities)
* Who owns these archives as a whole and their items (photos, text, other elements) individually? (beginning to answer: the groups who contributed them, the 'public', no one)
* What are we including? missing? leaving out? (beginning to answer: 'archived' frozen or cloned websites, social media images, oral history.; video recordings, physical media; those that didn't know or want to participate)
* What is the goal? (to build archives and tools to attempt to capture some part of the artist creative and intellectual output and the community that develops out of these spaces. to be caretakers and share these archives for future audiences / generations. to build awareness of archiving needs and tools that artist-run communities can use.)
