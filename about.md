# About Archiving Artist-Run Spaces

Archiving Artist-Run Spaces was created as a resource for experimental artist communities, both physical spaces as well as online-only creator communities, to build archives of their activities. It is based on my two decades of experience working in DIY spaces and artist-run communities and identifying unmet needs in the space. Just as these spaces attempt to carve out their own space in the world and make their own home and culture, there is a mismatch with their values when artist-run communities use commercial platforms for presenting or hosting their work. Just as an art space could be forced to close due to rising rents, many platforms have come and gone over the years, changed their business models, or sites or passwords have been misplaced. Recognizing that many exhibits, images, articles, web-based projects, and documentation disappears due to link rot this site's goal is to help artist-run communities think through the value of what they're engaged in and how they may want to strategically preserve some aspect of themselves online. This project isn't meant to replace the needs for professional archivists but rather to provide possibilities in the DIY spirit of these communities who often rely on the strength of their own networks.


## About the design of this site

This site was made with homemade, simple and open source tools with an eye toward creating an attractive website minimizing bandwidth and maximizing readability and longevity of the site. The pages are written in markdown, a lightweight language that is mostly just plaintext with some formatting marks, so it can be scanned and read itself, or rendered to a static HTML page. You are either reading this as the static website or as a markdown text file right now.

The style of the page is meant to reflect these values. No external fonts are loaded. Visitors will see default typefaces. The logo is a system emoji. There is no tracking on the website, no ads and no cookies. As far as one can know, no Google, Facebook, or Amazon resources have been used.

The style reflects maximizing text and making it easy to read and scan a page with your eyes or with page scanners. A palette of 8 colors was selected from lospec.com.

No Javascript is required to view or navigate the site. Media queries are used to resize the font for readability on small screens. Where possible, images have been compressed to support minimizing page load.

Pages are written in markdown and converted to html with a simple homemade static generator based on the free libre program Pandoc.
