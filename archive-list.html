<p>Description: Note: this site was archived by the Internet Archive
wayback machine but to the best of my knowledge was not preserved by the
organizers. Not all pages were saved. ‚ÄúArt Spaces Archives Project <a
href="#as-ap">AS-AP</a> is a non-profit initiative founded in 2003 by a
consortium of alternative arts organizations, including Bomb Magazine,
the College Art Association, Franklin Furnace Archive, New York State
Council on the Arts [NYSCA], New York State Artist Workspace Consortium,
and The Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, with a mandate to
help preserve, present, and protect the archival heritage of living and
defunct for- and not-for-profit art spaces in the United States from the
1950‚Äôs to the present.‚Äù</p>
<p>With funding provided by NYSCA, The National Endowment for the Arts,
and the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, AS-AP was initiated
with a mandate to begin the documentation process by constructing a
national index of the producers and presenters of alternative and
avant-garde art.</p>

Mondays</a></p>
<p>Description: ‚ÄúELEVATOR MONDAYS, a social exhibition space built
inside a decommissioned 4ft x 6ft freight elevator‚Ä¶.the project revolved
around weekly Monday night community BBQs at our studio building. These
pot-luck events were social opportunities for members of the LA art
community to come together and hang out once a week with friends and
food. Following in this tradition, ELEVATOR MONDAYS functions as a
social space for art and dialogue. The intimate scale and discrete
location of the space allows for a more personal, conversational
experience for both the viewers and the artists.‚Äù</p>

<p>Description: ‚ÄúExperimental Archive Space is an experimental archival
documentation project for a DIY arts organization. Space 1026 is a
23-year old DIY artist collective and studio, event, and printmaking

<p><a href="http://www.rf5.org/hbml/">HBML Documentation</a></p>
<p>Description: ‚ÄúHBML was a storefront arts space in Worcester MA in the
guise of a donation-based thrift store. HBML hosted exhibits by varying
artists and sold used goods‚Ä¶This is a series of web pages to serve as
incomplete documentation. Pictures are not ordered chronologically, in
themes, or in order of importance, but by file name. Things will be out
of order, but related pics have a strong likelihood of being grouped. I
think that‚Äôs as good a way to approach the material as any. No one
(except me I guess) experienced the store in a chronological way, it was
always just, you‚Äôd come in, and there were layers of things, echos of
the past, and areas of potential for future action. These pics are not
good documentation by art project standards, or by any standards really!
They were just taken by people at the store, or by me for some other
purpose, or by me for no purpose.‚Äù</p>

<p>Description: ‚ÄúIn 2017, I founded The Portal as a way to explore what
it means to archive performance, asking how an archive might operate as
a kind of‚Äùliving‚Äù space that develops protocols for process and
regeneration, attuning to the ways of knowing that emerge from embodied
practices.‚Äù</p>

<p>Description: What this site offers is a glimpse into the history of
writers and artists bound by the 128 characters that the American
Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) allowed them. The
focus is on mid-1980‚Äôs textfiles and the world as it was then, but even
these files are sometime retooled 1960s and 1970s works, and offshoots

<p>Description: ‚ÄúFounded in 1996, UbuWeb is a pirate shadow library
consisting of hundreds of thousands of freely downloadable avant-garde
artifacts. By the letter of the law, the site is questionable; we openly
violate copyright norms and almost never ask for permission. Most
everything on the site is pilfered, ripped, and swiped from other
places, then reposted. We‚Äôve never been sued‚Äînever even come close.
UbuWeb functions on no money‚Äîwe don‚Äôt take it, we don‚Äôt pay it, we don‚Äôt
touch it; you‚Äôll never find an advertisement, a logo, or a donation box.
We‚Äôve never applied for a grant or accepted a sponsorship; we remain
happily unaffiliated, keeping us free and clean, allowing us to do what
we want to do, the way we want to do it.‚Äù</p>
