<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Artist-run spaces, also called DIY Spaces or Alternative Spaces are
creative communities operating on the margins of cultural institutions.
They exist in a precarious space, currently affected by the economy,
pandemic, and gentrification. Many shuttered during the pandemic. Others
have struggled to make rent.</p>
<p>While artist-run communities of earlier eras are documented through
photographic prints, video, and publications, these recent communities
are primarily promoted and documented online, on closed proprietary
platforms, with an emphasis on immediacy but not on long term archiving.
An archive of creative activities are in danger of disappearing as
websites go down, platforms close or change their business plan. Even
when custom and personal websites are created, there is a danger they
could disappear, get hacked, or close down, or browser security and
protocols change, causing them to stop working.</p>
<p>Archiving Artist Spaces is a project to build a toolkit for
artist-run organizations providing information, training, tools and
other resources. In the first iteration, several pilot archives will be
set up in collaboration with artist-run spaces in LA, NYC and
Philadelphia. Some of these spaces are ongoing while others recently
closed during the pandemic.</p>
<p>In the second stage, the Archiving Artist-run Spaces project seeks
partnership with institutions concerned with longterm preservation of
artist communities and their work to build out longterm preservation
systems and caretaking. Partners include physical art archives, digital
libraries and public libraries and archives.</p>

<h2 id="in-progress-and-next-steps">In Progress and Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Expand partnering organizations. Conduct interviews, assess their
practices, help identify and build their archive through free open
source software tools</li>
<li>Create a toolkit of best practices to be shared with artist
organizations, presented online (website and youtube tutorial) and offer
workshops</li>
<li>Create software toolkit of open source software these organizations
can use</li>
<li>Secure funding for developing these tools, building website with
documentation, assist in costs for travel, and to pay honorariums</li>
<li>Secure an institutional partner(s) to serve as long term care takers
of these archives</li>
</ul>
